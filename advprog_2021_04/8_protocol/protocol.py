# Learn a bit about I/O handling, the implementation of I/O protocols,
# and the challenges of programming in a post-async environment.
#
# Introduction:
# -------------
# Arjoon, in implementing his Distributed Messaging System from
# project 4 is now focused on the problem of actually sending messages
# over network connections.  He has decided that each message will be
# encoded according to the following scheme:
#
# 1. The message type will be encoded as a UTF-8 string, terminated by
#    a newline (\r\n).
#
# 2. The message size (an integer) will be encoded as a UTF-8 string,
#    terminated by a newline (\r\n).
#
# 3. The message contents, encoded as UTF-8 JSON will follow. 
#     
# To illustrate, suppose that the following classes represent a few
# different kinds of messages:

class Message:
    _sequence = 0
    _registry = { }
    def __init__(self):
        Message._sequence += 1
        self.sequence = Message._sequence

    @classmethod
    def __init_subclass__(cls):
        Message._registry[cls.__name__] = cls

class ChatMessage(Message):
    def __init__(self, playerid, text):
        super().__init__()
        self.playerid = playerid
        self.text = text

class PlayerUpdate(Message):
    def __init__(self, playerid, x, y):
        super().__init__()
        self.playerid = playerid
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

# Here's how to encode a message according to the above protocol
def encode_message(msg):
    import json
    msgtype = type(msg).__name__.encode('utf-8') + b'\r\n'
    payload = json.dumps(msg.__dict__).encode('utf-8')
    size = str(len(payload)).encode('utf-8') + b'\r\n'
    return msgtype + size + payload

# An example that shows the encoding for a few messages
def example():
    msg1 = ChatMessage('Dave', 'Hello World')
    msg2 = PlayerUpdate('Paula', 23, 41)
    print(encode_message(msg1))
    print(encode_message(msg2))

# Exercise 1 - The recreator
#
# Taking a message and turning it into bytes is straightforward.  However,
# how do you actually get a message back?
#
# Your first task is to write a message creation function that takes
# the name of message type and the JSON-encoded payload (as text) and
# turns it back into a proper Python object.  The function should
# raise an exception if the specified message type doesn't correspond
# a valid message definition.
#
# Bonus: Could you also make the function enforce the presence of required
# message attributes?

message = ChatMessage('Dave', 'Hello World')

encoded_message = encode_message()



def recreate_message(msgtype, payload):
    mes_class = Message._registry[msgtype]
    message_type = json.loads(msgtype.decode('ascii'))
    pay_load = json.loads(payload.decode('ascii'))





    return # Python object

print(recreate_message())

def test_recreator():
    msg1 = recreate_message('ChatMessage', '{"sequence": 1, "playerid": "Dave", "text": "Hello World"}')
    assert isinstance(msg1, ChatMessage) and \
           msg1.sequence == 1 and \
           msg1.playerid == 'Dave' and \
           msg1.text == 'Hello World'

    msg2 = recreate_message('PlayerUpdate', '{"sequence": 2, "playerid": "Paula", "x": 23, "y": 41}')
    assert isinstance(msg2, PlayerUpdate) and \
        msg2.sequence == 2 and \
        msg2.playerid == 'Paula' and \
        msg2.x == 23 and \
        msg2.y == 41

    print("Ok creator.")

    try:
        msg3 = recreate_message('HackerMsg', '{"x": 666}')
        assert False, "Why did this work?!?!?! Bad creator!"
    except Exception as e:
        print("Good creator!")

    try:
        msg4 = recreate_message('PlayerUpdate','{"sequence": 3, "playerid": "Paula"}')
    except Exception as e:
        # Above message is missing fields for x/y.  Could this be caught?
        print("Very good creator!")

# Uncomment when ready        
# test_recreator()

# Exercise 2 - The Receiver
#
# To receive a message on a network connection, you've got to write
# code that receives fragments of bytes and reassembles them back into
# message objects.
#
# A common object used for network communication is a "socket".  A socket
# has a method sock.recv(maxsize) that receives bytes (up to a requested
# maximum size).  It returns an empty byte-string when a connection is 
# closed. 
#
# Your task is to write a generator function that reads raw bytes off
# of a socket and produces fully formed Message instances using the
# recreate_message() function you just wrote. Here's a skeleton:

def receive_messages(sock):
    while True:
        chunk = sock.recv(100000)    # Receive some data (actual size unknown)
        if not chunk:
            break
        # Reconstitute a message from the data (you implement)
        ...
        yield recreate_message(msgtype, payload)

# This test requires the use of the 'testmsg.py' script in this same directory.
# It must be running in a separate Python process (open a separate terminal 
# window and run it there). 
def test_receiver():
    print("Testing receiver")
    import socket
    sock = socket.create_connection(('localhost', 19000))
    messages = []
    for msg in receive_messages(sock):
        messages.append(msg)
    msg1 = messages[0]
    assert isinstance(msg1, ChatMessage) and \
           msg1.sequence == 1 and \
           msg1.playerid == 'Dave' and \
           msg1.text == 'Hello World'

    msg2 = messages[1]
    assert isinstance(msg2, PlayerUpdate) and \
        msg2.sequence == 2 and \
        msg2.playerid == 'Paula' and \
        msg2.x == 23 and \
        msg2.y == 41

    sock.close()
    print('Good receiver!')

# Uncomment when ready
# test_receiver()

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 3 - The Async
#
# After spending the entirety of self-imposed quarantine reading "Hacker News",
# The project manager has decided that it's critically important for
# messages to be received using "async" code instead of a normal
# Python function.  Thus, he has requested a new implementation of
# receive_messages() that makes use of Python's asyncio module instead.
#
# If you've never used asyncio before, this is not going to be a tutorial.
# However, asyncio provides a similar sock.recv() operation. It just 
# looks a bit different.  Here's a skeleton of the code you need to write:

import asyncio

async def areceive_messages(sock):
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    while True:
        chunk = await loop.sock_recv(sock, 100000) 
        if not chunk:
            break
        ...
        yield recreate_message(msgtype, payload)

# This test requires the use of the 'testmsg.py' script in this same directory.
# It must be running in a separate Python process (open a separate terminal 
# window and run it there). 
async def test_areceiver():
    print("Testing areceiver")
    import socket
    sock = socket.create_connection(('localhost', 19000))
    sock.setblocking(False)
    messages = []
    async for msg in areceive_messages(sock):
        messages.append(msg)

    msg1 = messages[0]
    assert isinstance(msg1, ChatMessage) and \
           msg1.sequence == 1 and \
           msg1.playerid == 'Dave' and \
           msg1.text == 'Hello World'

    msg2 = messages[1]
    assert isinstance(msg2, PlayerUpdate) and \
        msg2.sequence == 2 and \
        msg2.playerid == 'Paula' and \
        msg2.x == 23 and \
        msg2.y == 41

    sock.close()
    print('Good async receiver!')

# Uncomment to run the above test
# asyncio.run(test_areceiver())

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 4 - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) (Don't Repeat Yourself)
#
# For better or for worse, I/O handling in Python is split between two
# worlds.  There's the world of normal "synchronous" functions and threads
# (exercise 2) and the world of "asynchronous" functions (exercise 3).
# Unfortunately, these two execution models are basically incompatible
# with each other.  For example, if you tried to use the
# `receive_messages()` function from Exercise 2 inside of async code,
# it would block the internal event loop and prevent anything else
# from running.  Likewise, the `areceive_messages()` function from
# Exercise 3 can't even be called from normal Python functions because
# it requires the use of an "async" for-loop or an "await".
#
# A well-known rant about this problem can be found here:
# 
#   https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/
#
# However, this split between "sync" and "async" also presents a real
# programming challenge.  In many applications, there is critical
# "business logic" that is at the heart of what you are doing (i.e.,
# solving the actual problem).  You may not want to anchor it to a
# specific implementation of I/O. 
#
# An example of this is the code that implements the message decoding
# protocol in earlier exercises.  There's a pretty good chance that your
# implementations of `receive_messages()` and `areceive_messages()`
# are almost identical.  Yet, does most of that code need to be
# duplicated?   That is the challenge.
#
# Your task: Can you refactor the receive_messages() and
# areceive_messages() functions so that the protocol-related code is
# only implemented ONCE.  Here, "protocol" refers to the code that
# recognizes and decodes the parts needed to reconstruct Message
# objects (i.e., the message type, size, JSON payload, etc.). 
# Can that code be isolated in some manner that makes it usable from
# any I/O implementation?
#
# Note: Implementing I/O-independent protocols is increasingly common 
# in Python.  See https://sans-io.readthedocs.io.
