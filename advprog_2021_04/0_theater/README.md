# Welcome and warmup

This is mainly a "warmup problem" to make sure everyone has GitHub
access, can find the exercises, and is appropriately setup for editing
Python code.  However, the problem itself is also just a bit tricky.
One the main tasks we face in programming is that of "problem
solving."  In solving a problem, it helps to first understand the
problem itself, but also how to break down a larger problem into
smaller more manageable sub-problems.  So, that's the kind of thinking
you should explore here.

I'm not seeking a particular kind of solution to this problem, but you
should think about how you'd break the problem down into parts and how
you'd make your code something that could be generalized in a way that
allows it to be easily changed.
