# The owner of a monopolistic movie theater in a small town has
# complete freedom in setting ticket prices.  The more he charges, the
# fewer people can afford tickets.  The less he charges, the more it
# costs to run a show because attendance goes up.  In a recent
# experiment the owner determined a relationship between the price of
# a ticket and average attendance.
#
# At a price of $5.00/ticket, 120 people attend a performance.  For
# each 10-cent change in the ticket price, the average attendance
# changes by 15 people.  That is, if the owner charges $5.10, some 105
# people attend on the average; if the price goes down to $4.90,
# average attendance increases to 135.
#
# Unfortunately, the increased attendance also comes at an increased
# cost.  Every performance comes at a fixed cost of $180 to the owner
# plus a variable cost of $0.04 per attendee.
#
# The owner would like to know the exact relationship between profit
# and ticket price in order to maximize the profit.
#
# Write a program to figure out the best ticket price (to the nearest
# 10 cents) that maximizes profit.

def profit(ticket_price):
  num_of_people = ticket_price  
  show_cost = 180 + (.04 * num_of_people)
  ticket_price = ticket_price
  gross_profit = ticket_price * num_of_people
  net_profit = gross_profit - show_cost
