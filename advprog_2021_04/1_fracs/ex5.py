# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 5
#
# The function make_frac() is used to construct fractions. One feature
# of make_frac() is that it puts a fraction number into lowest terms and
# normalizes the sign to always appear in the numerator.  For example:
#
#    >>> a = make_frac(4, -6)
#    >>> a.numerator
#    -2
#    >>> a.denominator
#    3
#    >>>
#
# How would you modify the Fraction namedtuple class to have the same 
# behavior if you used it's normal constructor?
#
#    >>> a = Fraction(4, -6)
#    >>> a.numerator
#    -2
#    >>> a.denominator
#    3
#    >>>
#
# Disclaimer:  This is hard and not obvious.  But, it points to deeper
# problems. Maybe NamedTuple is not the solution we seek.
