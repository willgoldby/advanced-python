Welcome and Setup
-----------------

Welcome to Advanced Programming with Python.  There are a few basic
ground rules to start.  First, you need to clone and make your own
working branch of the course materials.  You should wait until the
start of the course to do this:

```
bash $ git clone https://github.com/dabeaz-course/advprog_2021_04
bash $ cd advprog_2021_04
bash $ git checkout -b yourname
bash $ git push -u origin yourname
```

For the remainder of the course, you should do all of the work in your
dedicated branch of the repository.  Moreover, I strongly encourage
you to commit and push the code in your branch throughout the
course. For example:

```
bash $ git commit -m "Solved project 1"
bash $ git push
```

There are a couple of benefits of doing this.  First, it allows me
to see your code and provide assistance. As an online course, I can't
walk around and see your screen.  Thus, you can't just call me over
for a debugging session.  However, if your code is pushed to GitHub,
we can look at it together.   Second, having your code here makes
it easier for everyone to compare notes and get ideas.  From the
GitHub web page, you can select a different branch and view the code.
For example, to view my code, select the "dabeaz" branch.

Use of the Issue Tracker
------------------------

For larger technical questions, I ask that you make use of GitHub
issues.  File a new issue to raise a question.  If you have commentary
or a solution to offer, please contribute to the issue.  I will also
answer issues throughout the course.

A benefit of using issues is that they keep conversations organized.
Not everyone works at the same pace.  Moreover, you might want to come
back to a problem later--maybe even after the course has ended. 
If everything is organized by issue, it can be easier to locate useful
discussion as opposed to searching the chat history of Zoom. 

Real-time Chat
--------------

For general discussion and chat, the course uses Gitter.  Please use
the following link:

Zoom Meeting Link
-----------------

The live course is conducted via Zoom.  The official course hours are
09:30-17:30 US CDT/CHICAGO (UTC-05:00).  I will be in the room approximately 30 minutes
prior to the start time. Here are access details:

Projects
--------

The course is organized around a collection of small projects. These
are found in different directories of the repository:

* `0_theater/`
* `1_fracs/`
* `2_owning/`
* `3_stacks/`
* `4_messages/`
* `5_state/`
* `6_returns/`
* `7_concurrent/`
* `8_protocol/`
* `9_puzzle/`

You will do all of your work in these directories and modify the files
that you find. But please make sure you're working in your own git
branch (see above).

Each project has a short README file that describes the objectives and
additionally includes a bit of information about Python as needed.

Live course sessions are recorded and will be posted here throughout the
course.
